# Underwater-Image-Processing
Test software for processing underwater images for purpose of making text more readable. Heavily based on Underwater-Image-Enhancement-and-Color-Restoration paper

Since the implementation is in test form, specific file strucutre is required. 
Once you have code on you device, root reposistory should have 3 folders 

InputImages
OutputImages
SRC

Location of said repository doesen't matter, but these folders must exist. 
InputImages is where you put images you want processsed. 
OutputImages is folder where processed images are stored
And src is all the code for all the algorithms



Requires: 
python
cv2
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
scikit-image
natsort
math
datetime
